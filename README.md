## Research Ideas
### NLP ML Models
- Build sentiment embeddings for news article headlines. These could be used to predict traffic of an article (within site testing) or the reliability of information in the article (once again within site testing - i.e. test bbc articles against other bbc articles, not against less reliable sites). How can we build these embeddings in such a way that it maximizes variation and information value while maintaining some level of interpretability? I'm going to actually try this one, I think
### Representation learning
- What if, instead of using large real-world values such as price, population, etc, we simply rounded those values to the nearest integer and used a list of the prime factors of that value. Would this change anything? How could we test it? (prime factorization list)
### Fun with rnn
- Many to many mapping of episode description to episode script. Allow user to write episode abstract, receive episode content. Have Andy Samberg act out the whole thing. (07_17_20)
