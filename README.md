## Research Ideas
### Representation learning
- What if, instead of using large real-world values such as price, population (prime factorization list)
### Fun with rnn
- Many to many mapping of episode description to episode script. Allow user to write episode abstract, receive episode content. Have Andy Samberg act out the whole thing. (07_17_20)
